Welcome to my new project! Counter Entrance: uLTIMA is my newest game, and my most ambitious yet! I am very proud to say that this will take me YEARS of development!! Waow..
I have plans to create some game art and a game booklet too, and maybe one of those bootleg cartridges if I end up with decent funding in the future!

v0.01:

I added the first rendition of the title screen, and I have started on creating the (first) main character's sprite work!

v0.02

I have finished the first main character's south movement animation cycle and their east/west animations too. 
I have created my first piece of full dialog and have started working on a text input system for a potential naming mechanic!
